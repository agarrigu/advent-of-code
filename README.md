# advent-of-code

My attempt at solving the [Advent of code][1] problems, in python.

Obviously these are much more fun to figure out on your own. This repository is mainly to learn _more_, aquire new angles of attack. Math Attack.

You should only view the code if you have already attempted to solve the problem or you __know__, **for sure**, you **never** will make the attempt.

Happy Coding!
